# MCP Meta-Analysis Server Submission

## Submission Type: Option A - Docker-Built Image (Recommended)

We are submitting our MCP Meta-Analysis Server for Docker to build and maintain with enhanced security features.

## What's New in This Submission

Our server has been significantly enhanced with AI capabilities powered by Claude SDK:

### 1. **RESTful API Gateway** (NEW)
- Full REST API at `/api/v1` with versioning
- Interactive OpenAPI/Swagger documentation at `/api-docs`
- Enterprise-grade security with Helmet, CORS, and rate limiting
- Follows US/French API design standards

### 2. **Intelligent Data Ingestion** (NEW)
Claude SDK agents that automatically:
- Fix common data format errors
- Calculate missing statistical values
- Detect and handle duplicate studies
- Validate statistical integrity
- Perform GRADE quality assessment

### 3. **Intelligent Code Linting** (NEW)
Multi-language support with AI enhancement:
- **R**: lintr + roxygen2 + statistical validation
- **Python**: flake8 + mypy + security scanning
- **TypeScript**: ESLint + tsc + modern patterns
- Claude adds context-aware suggestions and detects logical errors

### 4. **Core Features** (Enhanced)
All original features remain and are enhanced:
- Meta-analysis workflows with AI assistance
- Multiple effect measures (OR, RR, MD, SMD, HR)
- Publication-ready visualizations
- Comprehensive reporting

## Architecture

The server uses a modular architecture:
- **MCP Server**: Standard MCP protocol communication
- **API Gateway**: RESTful endpoints for integration
- **Claude Agents**: Intelligent processing pipeline
- **R Environment**: Containerized statistical computing

## Security & Compliance

- ✅ All dependencies updated to latest secure versions
- ✅ No hardcoded paths or credentials
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Session isolation for multi-user safety
- ✅ Optional AI features (works without API key)

## Testing

All features have been thoroughly tested:
- TypeScript compilation passes
- API endpoints functional
- Claude SDK integration verified
- R statistical functions validated
- Docker container builds successfully

## Documentation

- Comprehensive README with examples
- API documentation via OpenAPI/Swagger
- Architecture documentation included
- Claude.md for AI code assistance

## Why Option A?

We chose Docker-built images to benefit from:
- Cryptographic signatures for security
- Provenance tracking
- Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs)
- Automatic security updates
- Official `mcp/` namespace

## Repository
