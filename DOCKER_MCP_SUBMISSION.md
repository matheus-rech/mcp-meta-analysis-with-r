```

### 2. Create Feature Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feat/add-meta-analysis-ai-server
```

### 3. Add Our Server Entry
```bash
# Copy our prepared server.yaml
cp /path/to/our/mcp-registry-submission/servers/meta-analysis-r servers/
```

### 4. Commit with Proper Message
```bash
git add servers/meta-analysis-r/
git commit -m "feat: Add Meta-Analysis MCP Server with AI Enhancement

## 🚀 After PR Approval

Once approved, Docker will:
1. Build our image from the GitHub repository
2. Sign it with cryptographic signatures
3. Add provenance and SBOM data
4. Publish to `mcp/meta-analysis-r` on Docker Hub
5. Make it available in Docker Desktop's MCP Toolkit within 24 hours

## 📝 Important Notes

- We don't need to build/push our own image for Option A
- Docker will handle all the building and security features
- The image will be in the official `mcp/` namespace
- Automatic security updates will be provided

## 🎉 Benefits of Option A

1. **Enhanced Security**: Cryptographic signatures and provenance
2. **Trust**: Official Docker namespace
3. **Maintenance**: Automatic security updates
4. **Visibility**: Featured in Docker Desktop
5. **Support**: Docker team maintains the build
